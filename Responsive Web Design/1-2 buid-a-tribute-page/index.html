        <p id="description">Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>1912:</b> Alan Turing was born in London, United Kingdom.</li>
          <li><b>1931-1934:</b> He studied at the University of Cambridge, majoring in mathematics.</li>
          <li><b>1936:</b> Turing published his famous paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem," which laid the foundation for computer science.</li>
          <li><b>1938-1939:</b> He worked as a lecturer at the University of Cambridge, continuing his research in the field of computer science.</li>
          <li><b>1939-1945:</b> During World War II, Turing joined the British intelligence agency and made significant contributions to decrypting the Nazi German cipher systems. He led the effort to break the "Enigma" code and is credited with playing a crucial role in the Allies' victory during the war.</li>
          <li><b>1945-1947:</b> Turing returned to the University of Cambridge, where he continued his research in computer science and artificial intelligence.</li>
          <li><b>1950:</b> He published another important paper titled "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," in which he proposed the famous "Turing test" for evaluating whether a machine possesses human-level intelligence.</li>
          <li><b>1951:</b> Turing established the Computer Science Department at the University of Manchester and was responsible for designing and developing the world's first stored-program computer, the Manchester Mark 1.</li>
          <li><b>1952:</b> Turing was arrested and convicted for his homosexual relationship with another man. He underwent chemical castration as a form of punishment.</li>
          <li><b>1954:</b> Alan Turing passed away due to a suspected overdose of medication, which was deemed as suicide.</li>
